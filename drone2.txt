- Drone Sim
  - Written in Python
    - Using matplotlib and numpy would be nice, but if there is a better tool for the job use it
  - Plot 3 Axes (X, Y, Z) with respect to time
    - Main view is plotted isometrically (3D view) and one view from each perspective: XY, YZ, XZ
  - Config File Handler:
    - Loads/saves configuration via JSON file
  - Provide a choice of input states:
    - Travel in circle on XY plane
    - Bob up and down on Z plane
    - Spiral up and down on Z plane
  - Have some parameters easily modifiable on the GUI
    - Gravity
    - Number of propellers
    - Inertia
    - Thrust maximum
    - Reset state
  - Consider each of the variables regarding the drone state:
    - Position: [x, y, z] position in inertial frame
    - Velocity: [vx, vy, vz] linear velocity
    - Euler: [roll, pitch, yaw] angles (rad)
    - Omega: [p, q, r] angular velocity (rad/s)
  - Going forward, this project should allow for the following added features:
    - Accept a reinforcement learning model for the drone control loop
    - Accept force perturbation inputs that the drone must stabilize against
